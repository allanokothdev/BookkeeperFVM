Bookkeeper uses alternative data to improve credit scoring for sustainable women-owned businesses

# Problem & Solution
Women-owned Small and Medium Enterprises (WSMEs) in Africa are disproportionately affected by financial exclusion due to a variety of factors, including cultural and societal barriers, lack of collateral and credit history, and limited access to financial institutions. This is particularly true for women-owned businesses, which are twice as likely as men-owned businesses to be financially excluded.

Bookkeeper is a software as a service (SaaS) product that uses alternative data (sales and stock, transactions, payment info data) to support credit scoring for WSMEs. By analyzing alternative data sources, including, transactions, and other payment info, sales, stock data, Bookkeeper can provide a more comprehensive and nuanced view of a WSME's creditworthiness. By leveraging AI and analytics, it can also improve the accuracy and efficiency of credit scoring and reduce biases in lending decisions, helping banks and financial institutions make informed and gender-conscious lending decisions.

In addition to its primary goal of supporting credit scoring for WSMEs, Bookkeeper can also contribute to the goal of promoting sustainable finance and mitigating the impact of climate change by helping banks and financial institutions make informed and equitable lending decisions for WSMEs engaged in sustainable practices.

# Market Research
Financial exclusion refers to the inability of individuals or businesses to access financial products and services such as credit, loans, and savings accounts. In Africa, women-owned small and medium-sized enterprises (WSMEs) are disproportionately affected by financial exclusion due to a variety of factors, including cultural and societal barriers, lack of collateral and credit history, and limited access to financial institutions.

According to a report by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), only about one-third of WSMEs in Africa have access to formal financial services. This leaves a significant portion of WSMEs unable to access the credit and other financial products they need to grow and succeed.

In addition to the overall low levels of financial inclusion for WSMEs in Africa, there are also gender-based disparities in access to financial services. A report by the African Development Bank found that women-owned businesses in Africa are twice as likely as men-owned businesses to be financially excluded. This is due in part to the fact that women are less likely to have collateral or credit history, and are more likely to face discrimination and other barriers when trying to access financial services.

# Climate Impact
Facilitating credit scoring for women-owned small and medium-sized
enterprises (WSMEs) through Bookkeeper can have a positive
impact on climate change by enabling these businesses to access
green finance that can be used to invest in sustainable technologies
and practices. According to a report from UNDP, SMEs represent
about 90% of businesses and more than 50% of employment
worldwide and are responsible for up to 70% of energy consumption
and greenhouse gas emissions in many countries. By helping
WSMEs to access credit, Bookkeeper may enable these businesses
to invest in renewable-energy technologies or in energy efficiency
measures, such as upgrading to more efficient lighting or heating
systems. This can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
contribute to the transition to a low-carbon economy. By enabling
WSMEs to access finance that can be used in these ways,
Bookkeeper will be able to make a significant contribution to climate
change mitigation efforts.

# Gender Equality Impact

Facilitating credit scoring for women-owned small and medium-sized
enterprises (WSMEs) through Bookkeeper can have a positive
impact on gender equality by providing more equitable access to
financial resources and enabling WSMEs to grow. According to a
report from the IFC, "Women’s entrepreneurship and access to
finance are key drivers of economic development and social
inclusion. The potential for women’s entrepreneurship to drive
economic growth and reduce poverty is significant, yet women face
barriers to access to finance that men do not." By helping WSMEs to
access credit, Bookkeeper may be able to overcome some of these
barriers and enable WSMEs to thrive.
Supporting women-owned businesses has been shown to have a
range of positive impacts on communities and economies. For
example, a report from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM)
found that "women’s entrepreneurship can have a multiplier effect on
economic growth, leading to higher productivity, as well as increased
income and education outcomes for families." By enabling WSMEs to
access credit, Bookkeeper may be able to contribute to these
positive outcomes and promote gender equality.
